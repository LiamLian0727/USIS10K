This repository is the official implementation of "[Diving into Underwater: Segment Anything Model Guided Underwater Salient Instance Segmentation and A Large-scale Dataset]()", authored by Shijie Lian, Ziyi Zhang, Hua Li, Wenjie Li, Laurence Tianruo Yang, Sam Kwong, and Runmin Cong, which has been accepted by ICML2024! 🎉🎉🎉

If you found this project useful, please give us a star ⭐️ or cite us in your paper, this is the greatest support and encouragement for us.

## :rocket: Highlights:
- **USIS10K dataset**: We construct the first large-scale USIS10K dataset for the underwater salient instance segmentation task, which contains 10,632 images and pixel-level annotations of 7 categories. As far as we know, this is the **largest salient instance segmentation dataset** available that simultaneously includes Class-Agnostic and Multi-Class labels.

- **SOTA performance**: We first attempt to apply SAM to underwater salient instance segmentation and propose USIS-SAM, aiming to improve the segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenes. Extensive public evaluation criteria and large numbers of experiments verify the effectiveness of our USIS10K dataset and USIS-SAM model.

## Installation

### Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* Pytorch 2.0+
* [MMDetection](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) 3.0+
* mmengine
* mmcv>=2.0.0
* CUDA 12.1 or other version

### Installation
<details>
<summary>Environment Installation</summary>

**Step 0**: Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html) from the official website.

**Step 1**: Create a conda environment and activate it.

```shell
conda create -n usis python=3.19 -y
conda activate usis
```

**Step 2**: Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v212). If you have experience with PyTorch and have already installed it, you can skip to the next section. 

**Step 3**: Install MMEngine, MMCV, and MMDetection using MIM.

```shell
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0"
mim install mmdet
```

### Datasets

Please create a data folder in your working directory and put USIS10K in it for training or testing, or you can just change the dataset path in the [config file](project/our/config).
